# My Journey Through the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

**Background:** I have been through a number of online coding tutorials, primarily working in JS and C#.  Recently I've been trying to branch out into the more abstract side of computer science.

My goal is to become better at solving more complex problems, and building more sustainable systems.

I have looked into various institutions to assess the viability of a "collegiate" approach to attaining these goals, but based on my life circumstances feel that I would be better served in an independent environment. I came across the [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) program when I was searching online for independent compsci programs. I do not know about the success of this program, but I do not that with most things I get what I put into it.

This Gatsby site, is a blog of my experience working through this program over the summer.
