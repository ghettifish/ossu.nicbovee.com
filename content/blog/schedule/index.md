## Prereq's
In order to make sure I get the most out of this program, I must go through the prerequisites recommended on the [OSSU page](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). In highschool I slept through most of my math classes, which means today I can safely assume I need to work through High School Math to be comfortable with the prereqs.


## The Schedule
Schedules will be planned out 1 month in advance.
